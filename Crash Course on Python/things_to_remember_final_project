Things to remember 

    Before processing any text, you need to remove all the punctuation marks. To do this, you can go through each line of text, character-by-character, using the isalpha() method. This will check whether or not the character is a letter.
    To split a line of text into words, you can use the split() method.
    Before storing words in the frequency dictionary, check if theyâ€™re part of the "uninteresting" set of words (for example: "a", "the", "to", "if"). Make this set a parameter to your function so that you can change it if necessary.
